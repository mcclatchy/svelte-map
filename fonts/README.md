# Fonts

To use fonts with MapLibre GL, you can convert a `.ttf` file into glyphs using this [sdf-glyph-tool](https://github.com/protomaps/sdf-glyph-tool) repository, which also has a corresponding [web app](https://protomaps.github.io/sdf-glyph-tool/). Place that folder containing a bunch pf `.pbf` ranges into this `fonts` folder locally, and you should be able to access that glyph set as a font in your map.
